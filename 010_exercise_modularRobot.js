// buildGraph

// mailRoute
// routeRobot
// findRoute
// goalOrientedRobot

// If you were to write that project as a modular program, what modules would
// you create? Which module would depend on which other module, and what
// would their interfaces look like?
// Which pieces are likely to be available prewritten on NPM? Would you prefer
// to useRadiology Partners
